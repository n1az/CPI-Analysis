As a food lover who enjoys grocery shopping and cooking, this dataset on the Consumer Price Index (CPI)
for Germany (https://www-genesis.destatis.de/genesis//online?operation=table&code=61111-0003&bypass=true&levelindex=0&levelid=1713996336773#abreadcrumb)
is particularly interesting to me for many reasons like understanding the CPI trends for
food and beverages can help me budget more effectively for my grocery shopping. üç≤üõí

Possible questions to answer with these data:

1. How have food prices evolved over the last five years?

2. For which product (or group of products) CPI has been stable for the last five years?

3. What is the correlation between the CPI for dairy products and the CPI for meat products?

4. For which product (or group of products) CPI has been increased and decreased the most?

5. Can we predict future trends in food prices based on historical CPI data?
