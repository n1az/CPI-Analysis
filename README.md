# :dart: Project Overview #

As a food lover who enjoys grocery shopping and cooking, this [dataset on the Consumer Price Index (CPI)
for Germany](https://www-genesis.destatis.de/genesis//online?operation=table&code=61111-0003&bypass=true&levelindex=0&levelid=1713996336773#abreadcrumb) is particularly interesting to me for many reasons like understanding the CPI trends for
food and beverages can help me budget more effectively for my grocery shopping. üç≤üõí
